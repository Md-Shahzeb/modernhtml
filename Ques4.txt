Qno4. List any three ways which help us in improving the accessibility of html?
sol : following are the three ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
	* Use Semantic HTML elements:- Using semantic HTML elements helps improve accessibility by meaningful structure
	  to your content. Semantic elements like <header>,<nav>,<main>,<article>,and <footer> convey the purpose of 
	  different sections to assistive technologies,making it easier for user with disabilities to navigate and 
	  understand the content. 
	* Use colour with care:- Colour plays an important role in web design, but it should not be the only means of
	  conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning. it also maintain sufficient colour 
	  contrast between text and background to enchance readability for users with low visions.
	* Provide Alt Text for Images:- Adding descriptive alt text to images using the alt attribute ensures that users who
	  cannot see the images can understand their content and purpose. Screen readers read aloud the alt text,making visual 
	  content accessible to people with visual impairments.
